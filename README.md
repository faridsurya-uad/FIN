# FIN (Fix It Now) Project

FIN (Fix It Now) is a mobile application designed to streamline the reporting and repair process for broken public facilities on campus. It allows public users to capture photos of damaged facilities, upload them to the app, and notify administrators for prompt repairs. Administrators can update the repair status, and users can engage through comments, fostering a collaborative community for maintaining a functional campus environment.
